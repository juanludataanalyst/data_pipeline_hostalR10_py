Loading libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
reservations <- read_csv("data_2019/reservations.csv")
room_reservations <- read_csv("data_2019/room_reservations.csv")
room_names <- read_csv("data_2019/room_name.csv")
customers_data <- read_csv("data_2019/customers_data.csv")
customers_reservations <- read_csv("data_2019/customers_reservations.csv")



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
